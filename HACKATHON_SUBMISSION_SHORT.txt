Memocracy - AI-Powered Memecoin Intelligence & Community Governance Platform

PROJECT IDEA:
Memocracy transforms memecoin communities into self-governing ecosystems by combining Bags API token launches with AI-powered analytics, community governance, and transparent funding. We enable creators to launch tokens via Bags API with automatic multi-wallet fee distribution, while providing holders with token-gated voting, AI trust scores, and the ability to fund builders transparently through founding wallets.

HOW WE USE BAGS API:
1. Token Launch: Users launch new memecoins directly through our platform using Bags API
2. Multi-Wallet Fee Distribution: Configure multiple founding wallets (main, marketing, development, community fund) with custom fee splits
3. Fee Analytics: Real-time tracking of lifetime fees and distributions to each wallet
4. Governance Integration: Communities vote on fee allocation and project funding
5. Platform Fee: Automatic 3% platform fee included in Bags fee distribution

REVENUE MODEL:
Primary revenue comes from a 3% platform fee on all Bags-powered token launches, collected automatically through Bags fee distribution. With 100 launches in Year 1 (avg $500K volume, 2% fees = $10K per token), we generate $300 per token = $30K revenue. Year 2 (500 launches, $1M avg volume) = $300K revenue. Year 3 (2,000 launches, $2M avg volume) = $2.4M revenue. Additional revenue streams include premium features and enterprise solutions.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
$50B+ memecoin market with growing demand for transparency, governance, and builder funding. We're the first platform combining Bags API with comprehensive governance and AI analytics, solving real problems for thousands of memecoin communities and builders.
